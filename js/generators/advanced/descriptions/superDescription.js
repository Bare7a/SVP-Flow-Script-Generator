"The accuracy of the motion estimation. Value can only be 1, 2 or 4. 1 means a precision to the pixel, 2 means a precision to half a pixel, 4 - to quarter pixel (not recommended to use).",
"GPU usage mode: 0 - none, 1 - for frame rendering. Note that with \"gpu:1\" scaling up mode is always set to 0 cause subpixel planes are not actually used for frame rendering.",
"Turns on reduced super clip size when full=false, valid only with pel=1. It saves some memory and can be useful for processing extra large frames (like UHD (4K)).",
"Subpixel interpolation method for pel=2,4. <br/>0 for soft interpolation (bilinear),<br/> 1 for bicubic interpolation (4 tap Catmull-Rom),<br/> 2 for sharper Wiener interpolation (6 tap, similar to Lanczos).",
"Hierarchical levels smoothing and reducing (halving) filter.<br/>0 is simple 4 pixels averaging like unfiltered SimpleResize (old method);<br/>1 is triangle (shifted) filter like ReduceBy2 for more smoothing (decrease aliasing);<br/>2 is triangle filter like BilinearResize for even more smoothing;<br/>3 is quadratic filter for even more smoothing;<br/>4 is cubic filter like BicubicResize(b=1,c=0) for even more smoothing.",
