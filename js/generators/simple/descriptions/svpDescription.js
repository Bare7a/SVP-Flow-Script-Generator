"Set to True if you want to set the FPS to a specific value (60FPS/144FPS and so on), or you want to use the same as FPS that the source have multiploed by x2,x3.. and so on.",
"Depending on fixedFps value this can either be exact chosen fps (fixedFps = true) or a multiplayer for the current video (FixedFps = false)",
"Frames interpolation mode:<br/>0 - uniform interpolation for maximum smoothness. For example for 24->60 conversion output will be: \"1mmmm1mmmm...\", where \"1\" stands for original frame and \"m\" for interpolated one.<br/>1 - \"1m\" mode that gives \"1mm1m1mm1m...\" output in the above example => less artifacts at the cost of less smoothness.<br/>2 - \"2m\" mode: \"1m11m11m11...\" => much less artifacts and much less smoothness.<br/>3 - adaptive mode that switches between modes 0,1,2 based on overall vector field quality.",
"Rendering algorithm or \"SVP shader\", available values are:<br/>1 - sharp picture without any blending, moves pixels by motion vectors from next frame to current. Requires only backward motion vectors (\"analyse.vectors: 2\") so it's the fastest possible method.<br/>2 - like 1st but moves pixels from the nearest (in terms of time) frame so it uses both backward and forward vectors. Recommended for 2D animations.<br/>11 - time weighted blend of forward and backward partial motion compensations.<br/>13 - same as 11th but with dynamic median added. Produces minimum artifacts but with noticeable halos around moving objects.<br/>21 - 11th plus additional cover/uncover masking to minimize halos and improve frame edges.<br/>23 - 21th plus extra vectors from adjacent frames for further decreasing of halos, can be less smooth than 21th."]
